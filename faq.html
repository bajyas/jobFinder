        <h2>JobFinder for employers 101</h2>
        <h3>How is JobFinder different from other places where I can post jobs?</h3>
        <p>JobFinder is both a job search engine and all-in-one hiring platform. Beyond jobs posted directly by employers, JobFinder also aggregates job listings from thousands of sources across the internet, including job boards, company career websites, local news sites, staffing agencies and recruiter listings. Employers can post jobs directly on JobFinder for additional features, including screener questions, JobFinder Assessments, virtual interviews and more.

        47% of SMB employers surveyed who have used JobFinder, ZipRecruiter and LinkedIn say JobFinder is the best online source for quality hires.*

        <h3>Where do jobseekers go after clicking on my job posting?</h3>
        <p>When a person clicks on your job posting on JobFinder, they will be able to see the full job description and a button to apply. Candidates can then upload their resume if they are interested in the role.</p>

        <h3>Which applicant tracking systems work with JobFinder?</h3>
        <p>Many employers use applicant tracking systems (ATS) to manage online recruiting. For a full list of applicant tracking systems integrated with JobFinder, visit our ATS Integrations page.

            If you do not have an ATS, JobFinder has technology available at no charge that will allow you to track applicants when advertising on our site. You can manage all candidates that apply within your Worldwork Employer Dashboard. In your dashboard, you can review applications, schedule interviews and view recommended candidates. This dashboard is available for all employers that post jobs directly on JobFinder.</p>

        <h3>Is it free to post a job on JobFinder?</h3>
        <p>Most jobs on JobFinder can be posted for free.* But if you want a larger number of applicants, sponsoring your job gives your job post better visibility to jobseekers.

            *Terms, conditions, quality standards and usage limits apply.</p>

        <h2>Sponsored Jobs</h2>
        <h3>What are Sponsored Jobs?</h3>
        <p>A Sponsored Job is a paid job posting. When a jobseeker searches for a job on JobFinder, Sponsored Jobs get better visibility and appear for longer than non-sponsored jobs. Plus, we have found that sponsoring has a significant impact on hiring. Sponsored jobs are 5 times more likely to result in a hire*.

            Sponsoring a job also unlocks Matched Candidates, a feature that immediately gives you a list of candidates whose resumes on JobFinder match your job criteria as soon as you pay to post. When you see someone who might be a fit, you can invite them to apply.
            
            To learn more about sponsoring a job on JobFinder, check out our article Sponsored Jobs 101.

        <h3>When should I sponsor my job?</h3>
        <p>If you need to hire quickly or you are hiring a hard-to-fill position, sponsoring your job can make a huge difference.

            Here are a few things to consider when deciding if you should sponsor your job:
            
            If you need to make a hire urgently, sponsoring can help you get more quality applicants in less time.
            If the hiring market is competitive for the role you are hiring, sponsoring your job can attract more candidates.
            If you are hiring in a location with smaller pools of talent (e.g., small town), sponsoring your job can give it a boost so that it’s seen by more people.</p>

        <h3>How do I sponsor my jobs?</h3>
        <p>You can post a job directly on JobFinder to sponsor it. After adding your job description and other job details, JobFinder shows you the price per application* for your specific job title and location. You can reject unqualified applications before you are charged and stop promoting your job any time.

            *not available to all users
            
            You can also sponsor jobs from your career site or applicant tracking system. We will help you decide which jobs to promote and how to budget. Post your job to get started.
            
            You can sponsor your job at any time from your Employer Dashboard. Just click Sponsor Job on the right-hand side of the job you want to sponsor.</p>

        <h3>How does JobFinder calculate the price per application for my job post?</h3>
        <p>JobFinder takes into account your local market conditions as well as the job title and location for your job post. These factors influence the price per application at the specific moment you decide to sponsor your job post.</p>

        <h3>Will the price per application change in the future, even if I post the same job title?</h3>
        <p>Yes, the price depends on changing market conditions in your area. You will always see the price upfront before sponsoring.</p>

        <h3>How many jobs should I sponsor?</h3>
        <p>The number of jobs you should sponsor depends on the role you are hiring for, your location, how soon you need to make a hire and your hiring budget. We will help you prioritise the jobs you should sponsor by location, job title or industry.</p>

        <h3>How do I know where my Sponsored Jobs will appear?</h3>
        <p>When people search for jobs on JobFinder, they enter keywords relevant to their skills, interests and background. Your sponsored jobs will be displayed in search results when your job title, description, location and other information matches the search terms jobseekers are looking for.

            Sponsored Jobs remain prominently displayed in relevant search results for as long as they are sponsored. They do not fall back in search results over time like free listings do.</p>

        <h3>How can I measure the results of sponsoring my job on JobFinder?</h3>
        <p>JobFinder makes it easy to measure every aspect of their recruitment campaign. With JobFinder Analytics, a feature available with Sponsored Jobs, you will be able to understand the performance of your jobs across JobFinder. Here you can see high-level metrics, such as PPA (pay per application), applications, clicks, apply rate and total spend, and determine where to dive deeper.</p>

        <h2>Screener Questions</h2>
        <h3>Use screener questions</h3>
        <p>Screener questions let you quickly find out whether or not an applicant meets your criteria upfront. When you post a job on JobFinder, we’ll recommend pre-made screener questions to choose from based on your job title. You can also create your own custom questions.

            Example of screener questions include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>How many years of experience do you have in XYZ?</li>
            <li>Do you have a high school diploma?</li>
            <li>Do you have a valid [license type]?</li>
            <li>What percentage of the time are you willing to travel for work?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How do I add screener questions to my job post?</h3>
        <p>When you post a job on JobFinder, the Applicant Qualifications page will show you a list of pre-made questions or you can make your own. You can use a variety of question formats like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Yes or no</li>
            <li>Short answer</li>
            <li>Multiple choice</li>
            <li>Date or number</li>
            <li>Request for file upload</li>
        </ul>
