        <h2>Types of Job Scams:
        </h2>

        <div class="first-container">
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    <span>Payment Scams:</span> Be cautious of job postings that require you to pay a fee upfront or request your banking information before offering you a job. Legitimate employers will never ask you to pay for job opportunities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Identity Theft:</span> Watch out for job offers that request your personal information, such as your Social Security number, passport details, or driver's license, without a legitimate reason. Fraudsters may use this information for identity theft or other illegal activities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span>Work-from-Home Scams:</span> Exercise caution when considering remote job opportunities, especially those promising high pay with minimal effort. Some work-from-home scams may involve fraudulent schemes such as envelope stuffing, pyramid schemes, or reshipping scams.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Phishing Emails: </span> Be wary of unsolicited emails claiming to be from recruiters or employers, especially if they contain suspicious links or request sensitive information. These phishing attempts may lead to malware installation, identity theft, or financial loss.

            <h2>How to Protect Yourself:
            </h2>

            <p>
                <span>Research Employers:</span> Before applying for a job or responding to a job offer, research the employer and verify their legitimacy. Check for online reviews, company website, and contact information to ensure it matches with reputable sources.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>Be Skeptical of Unrealistic Offers:</span> If a job offer seems too good to be true, it probably is. Exercise caution when encountering job postings or emails promising high pay for minimal work, as they may be fraudulent.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>Protect Your Personal Information:</span> Never provide sensitive personal information, such as your Social Security number, bank account details, or passwords, unless you are certain of the legitimacy of the employer and job opportunity.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>Trust Your Instincts:</span>
                 If something feels off or suspicious about a job offer or communication, trust your instincts and proceed with caution. Don't hesitate to seek advice or report suspicious activities to JobFinder support team.
            </p>
